<h1>Facilitation Data Collection</h1>

<p>This page contains a list of data categories gathered from the Leading Practices of Facilitation, 
with the goal that individual institutions, sites, and centers collect data in these categories for evaluation 
of their own programs and impact.</p>

<p>You can access spreadsheets that have been pre-populated with these data categories in two ways: </p>
<ul>
<li> as Google Sheets in 
<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1eOOfl1QK00sPi8sBlacCOSwjEHrecSoM">this Google Drive folder</a></li>
<li>as a single Excel file, <a href="https://aciref.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/facilitation_data.xlsx">downloadable from the ACI-REF website</a> </li>
</ul>
